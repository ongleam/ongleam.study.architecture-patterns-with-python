Preface

You may be wondering who we are and why we wrote this book.

At the end of Harry’s last book, Test-Driven Development with
Python (O’Reilly), he found himself asking a bunch of questions about
architecture, such as, What’s the best way of structuring your

application so that it’s easy to test? More specifically, so that your

core business logic is covered by unit tests, and so that you minimize

the number of integration and end-to-end tests you need? He made
vague references to “Hexagonal Architecture” and “Ports and
Adapters” and “Functional Core, Imperative Shell,” but if he was

honest, he’d have to admit that these weren’t things he really
understood or had done in practice.

And then he was lucky enough to run into Bob, who has the answers to
all these questions.

Bob ended up a software architect because nobody else on his team
was doing it. He turned out to be pretty bad at it, but he was lucky

enough to run into Ian Cooper, who taught him new ways of writing
and thinking about code.

Managing Complexity, Solving Business
Problems

We both work for MADE.com, a European ecommerce company that
sells furniture online; there, we apply the techniques in this book to
build distributed systems that model real-world business problems.
Our example domain is the first system Bob built for MADE, and this

book is an attempt to write down all the stuff we have to teach new
programmers when they join one of our teams.

MADE.com operates a global supply chain of freight partners and
manufacturers. To keep costs low, we try to optimize the delivery of
stock to our warehouses so that we don’t have unsold goods lying
around the place.

Ideally, the sofa that you want to buy will arrive in port on the very day
that you decide to buy it, and we’ll ship it straight to your house

without ever storing it. Getting the timing right is a tricky balancing act
when goods take three months to arrive by container ship. Along the
way, things get broken or water damaged, storms cause unexpected

delays, logistics partners mishandle goods, paperwork goes missing,
customers change their minds and amend their orders, and so on.

We solve those problems by building intelligent software representing
the kinds of operations taking place in the real world so that we can
automate as much of the business as possible.

Why Python?

If you’re reading this book, we probably don’t need to convince you
that Python is great, so the real question is “Why does the Python
community need a book like this?” The answer is about Python’s

popularity and maturity: although Python is probably the world’s
fastest-growing programming language and is nearing the top of the
absolute popularity tables, it’s only just starting to take on the kinds of
problems that the C# and Java world has been working on for years.

Startups become real businesses; web apps and scripted automations
are becoming (whisper it) enterprise software.

In the Python world, we often quote the Zen of Python: “There should
be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.”
Unfortunately, as project size grows, the most obvious way of doing
things isn’t always the way that helps you manage complexity and
evolving requirements.

1

None of the techniques and patterns we discuss in this book are new,
but they are mostly new to the Python world. And this book isn’t a
replacement for the classics in the field such as Eric Evans’s Domain-
Driven Design or Martin Fowler’s Patterns of Enterprise
Application Architecture (both published by Addison-Wesley
Professional)—which we often refer to and encourage you to go and

read.

But all the classic code examples in the literature do tend to be written

in Java or C++/#, and if you’re a Python person and haven’t used
either of those languages in a long time (or indeed ever), those code
listings can be quite…trying. There’s a reason the latest edition of that
other classic text, Fowler’s Refactoring (Addison-Wesley
Professional), is in JavaScript.

TDD, DDD, and Event-Driven Architecture

In order of notoriety, we know of three tools for managing complexity:

1. Test-driven development (TDD) helps us to build code that is

correct and enables us to refactor or add new features,
without fear of regression. But it can be hard to get the best
out of our tests: How do we make sure that they run as fast as
possible? That we get as much coverage and feedback from
fast, dependency-free unit tests and have the minimum number
of slower, flaky end-to-end tests?

2. Domain-driven design (DDD) asks us to focus our efforts on
building a good model of the business domain, but how do we
make sure that our models aren’t encumbered with
infrastructure concerns and don’t become hard to change?

3. Loosely coupled (micro)services integrated via messages
(sometimes called reactive microservices) are a well-
established answer to managing complexity across multiple
applications or business domains. But it’s not always obvious
how to make them fit with the established tools of the Python
world—Flask, Django, Celery, and so on.

NOTE

Don’t be put off if you’re not working with (or interested in) microservices. The
vast majority of the patterns we discuss, including much of the event-driven
architecture material, is absolutely applicable in a monolithic architecture.

Our aim with this book is to introduce several classic architectural
patterns and show how they support TDD, DDD, and event-driven
services. We hope it will serve as a reference for implementing them

in a Pythonic way, and that people can use it as a first step toward
further research in this field.

Who Should Read This Book

Here are a few things we assume about you, dear reader:

You’ve been close to some reasonably complex Python
applications.

You’ve seen some of the pain that comes with trying to
manage that complexity.

You don’t necessarily know anything about DDD or any of the
classic application architecture patterns.

We structure our explorations of architectural patterns around an
example app, building it up chapter by chapter. We use TDD at work,
so we tend to show listings of tests first, followed by implementation.
If you’re not used to working test-first, it may feel a little strange at the
beginning, but we hope you’ll soon get used to seeing code “being
used” (i.e., from the outside) before you see how it’s built on the
inside.

We use some specific Python frameworks and technologies, including
Flask, SQLAlchemy, and pytest, as well as Docker and Redis. If
you’re already familiar with them, that won’t hurt, but we don’t think

it’s required. One of our main aims with this book is to build an
architecture for which specific technology choices become minor
implementation details.

A Brief Overview of What You’ll Learn

The book is divided into two parts; here’s a look at the topics we’ll
cover and the chapters they live in.

Part I, Building an Architecture to Support Domain
Modeling

Domain modeling and DDD (Chapters 1 and 7)

At some level, everyone has learned the lesson that complex
business problems need to be reflected in code, in the form of a
model of the domain. But why does it always seem to be so hard to
do without getting tangled up with infrastructure concerns, our web
frameworks, or whatever else? In the first chapter we give a broad
overview of domain modeling and DDD, and we show how to get
started with a model that has no external dependencies, and fast
unit tests. Later we return to DDD patterns to discuss how to
choose the right aggregate, and how this choice relates to questions
of data integrity.

Repository, Service Layer, and Unit of Work patterns (Chapters 2, 4,
and 5)

In these three chapters we present three closely related and
mutually reinforcing patterns that support our ambition to keep the
model free of extraneous dependencies. We build a layer of
abstraction around persistent storage, and we build a service layer
to define the entrypoints to our system and capture the primary use
cases. We show how this layer makes it easy to build thin
entrypoints to our system, whether it’s a Flask API or a CLI.

Some thoughts on testing and abstractions (Chapters 3 and 6)

After presenting the first abstraction (the Repository pattern), we
take the opportunity for a general discussion of how to choose
abstractions, and what their role is in choosing how our software
is coupled together. After we introduce the Service Layer pattern,
we talk a bit about achieving a test pyramid and writing unit tests
at the highest possible level of abstraction.

Part II, Event-Driven Architecture

Event-driven architecture (Chapters 8–11)

We introduce three more mutually reinforcing patterns: the Domain
Events, Message Bus, and Handler patterns. Domain events are a
vehicle for capturing the idea that some interactions with a system
are triggers for others. We use a message bus to allow actions to
trigger events and call appropriate handlers. We move on to
discuss how events can be used as a pattern for integration
between services in a microservices architecture. Finally, we
distinguish between commands and events. Our application is now
fundamentally a message-processing system.

Command-query responsibility segregation (Chapter 12)

We present an example of command-query responsibility
segregation, with and without events.

Dependency injection (Chapter 13)

We tidy up our explicit and implicit dependencies and implement a
simple dependency injection framework.

Addtional Content

How do I get there from here? (Epilogue)

Implementing architectural patterns always looks easy when you
show a simple example, starting from scratch, but many of you will
probably be wondering how to apply these principles to existing
software. We’ll provide a few pointers in the epilogue and some
links to further reading.

Example Code and Coding Along

You’re reading a book, but you’ll probably agree with us when we say
that the best way to learn about code is to code. We learned most of

what we know from pairing with people, writing code with them, and
learning by doing, and we’d like to re-create that experience as much

as possible for you in this book.

As a result, we’ve structured the book around a single example project
(although we do sometimes throw in other examples). We’ll build up

this project as the chapters progress, as if you’ve paired with us and
we’re explaining what we’re doing and why at each step.

But to really get to grips with these patterns, you need to mess about

with the code and get a feel for how it works. You’ll find all the code
on GitHub; each chapter has its own branch. You can find a list of the

branches on GitHub as well.

Here are three ways you might code along with the book:

Start your own repo and try to build up the app as we do,
following the examples from listings in the book, and
occasionally looking to our repo for hints. A word of
warning, however: if you’ve read Harry’s previous book and
coded along with that, you’ll find that this book requires you
to figure out more on your own; you may need to lean pretty
heavily on the working versions on GitHub.

Try to apply each pattern, chapter by chapter, to your own
(preferably small/toy) project, and see if you can make it
work for your use case. This is high risk/high reward (and
high effort besides!). It may take quite some work to get things
working for the specifics of your project, but on the other
hand, you’re likely to learn the most.

For less effort, in each chapter we outline an “Exercise for
the Reader,” and point you to a GitHub location where you
can download some partially finished code for the chapter
with a few missing parts to write yourself.

Particularly if you’re intending to apply some of these patterns in your

own projects, working through a simple example is a great way to
safely practice.

TIP

At the very least, do a git checkout of the code from our repo as you read each
chapter. Being able to jump in and see the code in the context of an actual
working app will help answer a lot of questions as you go, and makes everything
more real. You’ll find instructions for how to do that at the beginning of each
chapter.
