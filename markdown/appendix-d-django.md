Appendix D. Repository and
Unit of Work Patterns with
Django

Suppose you wanted to use Django instead of SQLAlchemy and Flask.
How might things look? The first thing is to choose where to install it.
We put it in a separate package next to our main allocation code:

Repository Pattern with Django

We used a plug-in called pytest-django to help with test database
management.

Rewriting the first repository test was a minimal change—just
rewriting some raw SQL with a call to the Django ORM/QuerySet
language:

First repository test adapted (tests/integration/test_repository.py)

from djangoproject.alloc import models as django_models

@pytest.mark.django_db
def test_repository_can_save_a_batch():
    batch = model.Batch("batch1", "RUSTY-SOAPDISH", 100, eta=date(2011, 12, 25))

    repo = repository.DjangoRepository()
    repo.add(batch)

    [saved_batch] = django_models.Batch.objects.all()
    assert saved_batch.reference == batch.reference
    assert saved_batch.sku == batch.sku

    assert saved_batch.qty == batch._purchased_quantity
    assert saved_batch.eta == batch.eta

The second test is a bit more involved since it has allocations, but it is
still made up of familiar-looking Django code:

Second repository test is more involved
(tests/integration/test_repository.py)

@pytest.mark.django_db
def test_repository_can_retrieve_a_batch_with_allocations():
    sku = "PONY-STATUE"
    d_line = django_models.OrderLine.objects.create(orderid="order1", sku=sku,
qty=12)
    d_b1 = django_models.Batch.objects.create(
    reference="batch1", sku=sku, qty=100, eta=None
)
    d_b2 = django_models.Batch.objects.create(
    reference="batch2", sku=sku, qty=100, eta=None
)
    django_models.Allocation.objects.create(line=d_line, batch=d_batch1)

    repo = repository.DjangoRepository()
    retrieved = repo.get("batch1")

    expected = model.Batch("batch1", sku, 100, eta=None)
    assert retrieved == expected  # Batch.__eq__ only compares reference
    assert retrieved.sku == expected.sku
    assert retrieved._purchased_quantity == expected._purchased_quantity
    assert retrieved._allocations == {
        model.OrderLine("order1", sku, 12),
    }

Here’s how the actual repository ends up looking:

A Django repository (src/allocation/adapters/repository.py)

class DjangoRepository(AbstractRepository):

    def add(self, batch):
        super().add(batch)
        self.update(batch)

    def update(self, batch):
        django_models.Batch.update_from_domain(batch)

    def _get(self, reference):
        return django_models.Batch.objects.filter(
            reference=reference
        ).first().to_domain()

    def list(self):
        return [b.to_domain() for b in django_models.Batch.objects.all()]

You can see that the implementation relies on the Django models
having some custom methods for translating to and from our domain
model.

Custom Methods on Django ORM Classes to
Translate to/from Our Domain Model

Those custom methods look something like this:

Django ORM with custom methods for domain model conversion
(src/djangoproject/alloc/models.py)

from django.db import models
from allocation.domain import model as domain_model

class Batch(models.Model):
    reference = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    sku = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    qty = models.IntegerField()
    eta = models.DateField(blank=True, null=True)

    @staticmethod
    def update_from_domain(batch: domain_model.Batch):

        try:
            b = Batch.objects.get(reference=batch.reference)
        except Batch.DoesNotExist:
            b = Batch(reference=batch.reference)
        b.sku = batch.sku
        b.qty = batch._purchased_quantity
        b.eta = batch.eta
        b.save()
        b.allocation_set.set(
            Allocation.from_domain(l, b)
            for l in batch._allocations
        )

    def to_domain(self) -> domain_model.Batch:
        b = domain_model.Batch(
            ref=self.reference, sku=self.sku, qty=self.qty, eta=self.eta
        )
        b._allocations = set(
            a.line.to_domain()
            for a in self.allocation_set.all()
        )
        return b

class OrderLine(models.Model):
    #...

For value objects, objects.get_or_create can work, but for
entities, you probably need an explicit try-get/except to handle the
upsert.

We’ve shown the most complex example here. If you do decide to
do this, be aware that there will be boilerplate! Thankfully it’s not
very complex boilerplate.

Relationships also need some careful, custom handling.

NOTE

As in Chapter 2, we use dependency inversion. The ORM (Django) depends on
the model and not the other way around.

Unit of Work Pattern with Django

The tests don’t change too much:

Adapted UoW tests (tests/integration/test_uow.py)

def insert_batch(ref, sku, qty, eta):
    django_models.Batch.objects.create(reference=ref, sku=sku, qty=qty, eta=eta)

def get_allocated_batch_ref(orderid, sku):
    return django_models.Allocation.objects.get(
        line__orderid=orderid, line__sku=sku
    ).batch.reference

@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)
def test_uow_can_retrieve_a_batch_and_allocate_to_it():
    insert_batch('batch1', 'HIPSTER-WORKBENCH', 100, None)

    uow = unit_of_work.DjangoUnitOfWork()
    with uow:
        batch = uow.batches.get(reference='batch1')
        line = model.OrderLine('o1', 'HIPSTER-WORKBENCH', 10)
        batch.allocate(line)
        uow.commit()

    batchref = get_allocated_batch_ref('o1', 'HIPSTER-WORKBENCH')
    assert batchref == 'batch1'

@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)

def test_rolls_back_uncommitted_work_by_default():
    ...

@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)
def test_rolls_back_on_error():
    ...

Because we had little helper functions in these tests, the actual
main bodies of the tests are pretty much the same as they were with
SQLAlchemy.

The pytest-django mark.django_db(transaction=True) is
required to test our custom transaction/rollback behaviors.

And the implementation is quite simple, although it took me a few tries
to find which invocation of Django’s transaction magic would work:

UoW adapted for Django

(src/allocation/service_layer/unit_of_work.py)

class DjangoUnitOfWork(AbstractUnitOfWork):

    def __enter__(self):
        self.batches = repository.DjangoRepository()
        transaction.set_autocommit(False)
        return super().__enter__()

    def __exit__(self, *args):
        super().__exit__(*args)
        transaction.set_autocommit(True)

    def commit(self):
        for batch in self.batches.seen:
            self.batches.update(batch)
        transaction.commit()

    def rollback(self):
        transaction.rollback()

set_autocommit(False) was the best way to tell Django to stop
automatically committing each ORM operation immediately, and to
begin a transaction.

Then we use the explicit rollback and commits.

One difficulty: because, unlike with SQLAlchemy, we’re not
instrumenting the domain model instances themselves, the
commit() command needs to explicitly go through all the objects
that have been touched by every repository and manually update
them back to the ORM.

API: Django Views Are Adapters

The Django views.py file ends up being almost identical to the old

flask_app.py, because our architecture means it’s a very thin wrapper
around our service layer (which didn’t change at all, by the way):

Flask app → Django views (src/djangoproject/alloc/views.py)

os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'djangoproject.django_project.settings'
django.setup()

@csrf_exempt
def add_batch(request):
    data = json.loads(request.body)
    eta = data['eta']
    if eta is not None:
        eta = datetime.fromisoformat(eta).date()
    services.add_batch(
        data['ref'], data['sku'], data['qty'], eta,
        unit_of_work.DjangoUnitOfWork(),
    )
    return HttpResponse('OK', status=201)

@csrf_exempt

def allocate(request):
    data = json.loads(request.body)
    try:
        batchref = services.allocate(
            data['orderid'],
            data['sku'],
            data['qty'],
            unit_of_work.DjangoUnitOfWork(),
        )
    except (model.OutOfStock, services.InvalidSku) as e:
        return JsonResponse({'message': str(e)}, status=400)

    return JsonResponse({'batchref': batchref}, status=201)

Why Was This All So Hard?

OK, it works, but it does feel like more effort than Flask/SQLAlchemy.

Why is that?

The main reason at a low level is because Django’s ORM doesn’t
work in the same way. We don’t have an equivalent of the
SQLAlchemy classical mapper, so our ActiveRecord and our domain
model can’t be the same object. Instead we have to build a manual

translation layer behind the repository. That’s more work (although
once it’s done, the ongoing maintenance burden shouldn’t be too high).

Because Django is so tightly coupled to the database, you have to use
helpers like pytest-django and think carefully about test databases,
right from the very first line of code, in a way that we didn’t have to
when we started out with our pure domain model.

But at a higher level, the entire reason that Django is so great is that

it’s designed around the sweet spot of making it easy to build CRUD
apps with minimal boilerplate. But the entire thrust of our book is

about what to do when your app is no longer a simple CRUD app.

At that point, Django starts hindering more than it helps. Things like
the Django admin, which are so awesome when you start out, become

actively dangerous if the whole point of your app is to build a complex
set of rules and modeling around the workflow of state changes. The

Django admin bypasses all of that.

What to Do If You Already Have Django

So what should you do if you want to apply some of the patterns in this

book to a Django app? We’d say the following:

The Repository and Unit of Work patterns are going to be
quite a lot of work. The main thing they will buy you in the
short term is faster unit tests, so evaluate whether that benefit
feels worth it in your case. In the longer term, they decouple
your app from Django and the database, so if you anticipate
wanting to migrate away from either of those, Repository and
UoW are a good idea.

The Service Layer pattern might be of interest if you’re seeing
a lot of duplication in your views.py. It can be a good way of
thinking about your use cases separately from your web
endpoints.

You can still theoretically do DDD and domain modeling with
Django models, tightly coupled as they are to the database;
you may be slowed by migrations, but it shouldn’t be fatal. So

as long as your app is not too complex and your tests not too
slow, you may be able to get something out of the fat models
approach: push as much logic down to your models as
possible, and apply patterns like Entity, Value Object, and
Aggregate. However, see the following caveat.

With that said, word in the Django community is that people find that
the fat models approach runs into scalability problems of its own,

particularly around managing interdependencies between apps. In

those cases, there’s a lot to be said for extracting out a business logic
or domain layer to sit between your views and forms and your

models.py, which you can then keep as minimal as possible.

Steps Along the Way

Suppose you’re working on a Django project that you’re not sure is

going to get complex enough to warrant the patterns we recommend,
but you still want to put a few steps in place to make your life easier,

both in the medium term and if you want to migrate to some of our
patterns later. Consider the following:

One piece of advice we’ve heard is to put a logic.py into
every Django app from day one. This gives you a place to put
business logic, and to keep your forms, views, and models
free of business logic. It can become a stepping-stone for
moving to a fully decoupled domain model and/or service
layer later.

A business-logic layer might start out working with Django
model objects and only later become fully decoupled from the
framework and work on plain Python data structures.

For the read side, you can get some of the benefits of CQRS
by putting reads into one place, avoiding ORM calls
sprinkled all over the place.

When separating out modules for reads and modules for
domain logic, it may be worth decoupling yourself from the
Django apps hierarchy. Business concerns will cut across
them.

NOTE

We’d like to give a shout-out to David Seddon and Ashia Zawaduk for talking
through some of the ideas in this appendix. They did their best to stop us from
saying anything really stupid about a topic we don’t really have enough personal
experience of, but they may have failed.

For more thoughts and actual lived experience dealing with existing

applications, refer to the epilogue.

1  The DRY-Python project people have built a tool called mappers that looks like it might

help minimize boilerplate for this sort of thing.

2  @mr-bo-jangles suggested you might be able to use update_or_create, but that’s

beyond our Django-fu.
